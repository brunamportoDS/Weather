Project Weather
Comparison of rain volume in different locations

Project Overview
This project investigates whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in Portland, OR. Using daily precipitation data from NOAA (2018–2022), we applied data science methods to compare rainfall patterns. The analysis provides a data-driven answer to the long-debated question of which city is truly rainier.

Objective: Determine whether Seattle or Portland experiences more rainfall using NOAA daily precipitation data (2018–2022).
Domain: Climate
Key Techniques: (e.g., Regression, Classification, Clustering, NLP, Time Series)
